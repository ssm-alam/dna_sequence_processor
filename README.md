# dna_sequence_processor

This repository contains a Python script for processing DNA sequences.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssm-alam/dna_sequence_processor.git
   cd dna_sequence_processor
2. Replace PASTE_YOUR_REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_HERE with your reference sequence in the script sequence_processor.py.
3. Replace SPECIFY_THE_PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE_HERE.txt with the path to your input file in the script.
4. Place your input file in the specified path.
5. Run the script using Python:
6. ```bash
   python sequence_processor.py
   ```
 
The processed sequences will be saved in output_sequences.txt.
## Script Description
The script reads a file containing DNA sequences, processes them according to a predefined sequence (seq1), and saves the results. The processing involves replacing certain ambiguous nucleotides (N, R, W, Y, M, K, S, D, V, H, B, X) in the input sequences with corresponding nucleotides from seq1.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
